Community Connect is a platform designed for Graphic Era students to share rides, lend unused items, and help each other with local queries. Our goal is to foster a supportive and sustainable student community.

Features
- Ride Sharing: Students can offer and find rides to different locations.
- Item Lending: Share items you don't use anymore and borrow from others.
Help & Queries: Ask questions like "Where is the nearest Puncture Shop?" and get quick responses.
Community Support: Build a network of helping hands among students.
